1.0e-12 toltail - maximum size of the tail (sum of the 1-norms of the fourier coefficients)
1.0e-10 tolinva - tolerance for invariance. Compute the error and take its norm. If that is smaller thatn tolinva, we have successfully completed the computation
1.0e-16 tolinte - tolerance for the intermediate computation (matrix inverses)
0.618033988749894848 omega
0.0 epsilon
32 nn
1e-2 deps
0 auxint I can use this to add extra inputs like the initial conditions of the torus
